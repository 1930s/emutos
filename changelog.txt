Start... early ages

16. May. 1985
- GEMDOS 1.0 released by Digital Research, Inc.

05. Jun. 1987  ACH	PROC.C
- Problem - After physical disk error COMMAND.PRG gives "Command not
  found." message for all subsequent external commands. Fix - Changed the
  error handling code in  xexec() to always do an ixterm(t); on any disk
  error, thus freeing memory.

26. Jun. 1987  ACH	TIME.C & BIOS
- To enable GEMDOS to take advantage of real-time clock/calendars a new
  BIOS function (11h) has been added. Whenever the BDOS sets a new time
  or date this function is called and, if the hardware supports it, the
  real-time clock can be updated. When the BDOS needs the current time or
  date the function is called to allow  the BIOS to update the internal
  BDOS values. If there is no hardware clock the BIOS can  simply ignore
  this call as the BDOS still maintains the time and date internally
  based on the system tick.

16. Sep. 1987  ACH	SUP.C
- Problem - the internal date and time variables used to time stamp file
  updates are set to 0 when the OS starts up.

  Fix - Changed cinit() in SUP.C to call new BIOS date_time() function
  (11h) so that the BIOS can initialise the internal variables from a 
  hardware real-time clock, if supported.

09. Oct. 1987 ACH	BDOSMAIN.C
- Duplicate definition of supstk and SUPSIZ removed from this module.
  (Duplicated in  PROC.C and FS.H.) If the supervisor stack is to be OEM 
  configurable some more reliable method must be devised.

19. Nov. 1987 ACH	RWA.A
- Added _lbmove, _bfill, _bmove routines. (These were supposed to be in
  something called TOOLS.ARC which was not supplied by DRI.)
