Dear Atari Community!


We are happy to announce a new public release of EmuTOS:

EmuTOS 0.9.1 -- July 3rd, 2013



INTRODUCTION

EmuTOS is a single-user single-tasking operating system for the 32-bit Atari
computers, clones and emulators. It can be used as a replacement for the TOS
images typically needed today for using emulators and can also run on some
real hardware, like the Atari STe, Falcon and the FireBee. It can even run
on non-Atari hardware such as Amiga and ColdFire Evaluation Boards.
All the source code is open and free, licensed under the GNU General Public
License (GPL).



CHANGES SINCE LAST RELEASE

Major changes:
- Added support for the ColdFire Evaluation Boards.
- Added 256 colour support for VIDEL systems.
- Added new EmuCON2, with TAB completion.
- Added support for renaming folders.
- Added the XBIOS DMA sound functions.
- Included the full-featured desktop in 192K ROMs.

Other changes:
- Fixed regression: FOLDR100 message on Malloc() memory exhausted.
- Improved filesystem performance.
- Added new firebee-ram target.
- Improved desktop file copy performance.
- Improved boot speed on machines with Fast RAM.
- Fixed stack issue to allow running XaAES with GEM=ROM.
- Fixed endless loop if zero divide on ColdFire.
- Fixed compilation for m68k-elf toolchain with -g.
- Added XHMiNTInfo to the XHDI handler.
- Combined file and folder information dialogs.
- Combined copy and delete desktop dialogs.
- Added support for redirecting console I/O to the serial port.
- Automatically centre desktop dialog titles.
- Reduced ROM space usage by rewriting or eliminating many routines.
- Changed icon display in desktop windows to eliminate horizontal scrolling.
- Fixed vq_chcells().
- Added support for 256 colours on desktop.
- Fixed XHInqDriver().
- Fixed mkrom.c for 64-bit build systems.
- Many internal code fixes and cleanups.

Have a look at changelog.txt for more detailed information.



DESCRIPTION

EmuTOS is basically made up of the following:

- The BIOS, which is the basic input output system
- The XBIOS, which provides the interface to the hardware
- The BDOS, which are the high level OS routines, often known as GEMDOS
- The VDI, the virtual device interface, i.e. the screen driver
- The AES, the application environment services or window manager
- The desktop, which is the graphical shell to the user
- EmuCON2, the command-line interpreter

The BIOS and XBIOS code is our own development. It is written from
scratch and implements all relevant TOS 1.0 Bios & XBIOS functionality,
and a bit more, e.g. hard disk access. See doc/status.txt for details.

The GEMDOS part is based on Digital Research's GEMDOS sources, which were
made available under GPL license in 1999 by Caldera.

The graphical parts like VDI and AES are now more or less fully
implemented up to TOS v1.04 level. They work in all the graphics modes
of the original Atari ST, with some extensions. For example, systems with
VIDEL support 256 colours and 640x480 screen resolution. Some emulators
can patch EmuTOS to work with much bigger screen resolutions.

The desktop is somewhat better than the original one, but not as nice as
the one in TOS 2 or higher. It is still quite usable, and of course you are
always free to use a more advanced desktop replacement like TeraDesk.

EmuCON2 is a basic but useful command-line interpreter, written from scratch
by Roger Burrows in 2013.

Since EmuTOS just implements TOS functionality, you might want to use
MiNT on top of it in order to run more modern software. EmuTOS is not
an alternative to MiNT, but it's the only free base OS to boot MiNT.



EMULATION AND FUTURE PLATFORM

EmuTOS and MiNT cooperate well. Both can utilize Native Features
(NatFeats) interface for emulators:
    http://wiki.aranym.org/natfeats/proposal

EmuTOS uses this new standard interface for all the relevant native
functions supported by an emulator on which it's running. This interface
proxies the calls to the underlying host OS so that these features don't
need to be emulated. This is both faster and can provide features that
would be infeasible on a real machine. It may allow using modern graphics
cards, provide fast native filesystem access and enable you to use
networking with all bells and whistles - and many other things you might
not have even dreamed of.

The ARAnyM emulator has the most extensive support for NatFeats.
The Hatari emulator supports the basic NatFeats facilities.



HARDWARE

Making EmuTOS run natively on a new hardware platform is more or less just
a question of driver support for EmuTOS. The same for MiNT, if you'd like
to have it running on top of EmuTOS.

This is the currently supported Atari hardware:

- CPU support for m68000, m68010, m68020, m68030, m68040, m68060, ColdFire V4e
- FPU detected
- 68030 MMU and cache
- Memory controller (both ST and Falcon)
- Monitor type detection (mono, RGB or VGA)
- DMA controller
- WD 1772 / AJAX Floppy disk controller (write track not tested)
- MFP
- PSG
- ST shifter
- STe shifter
- VIDEL
- ACIAs, IKBD protocol, mouse
- MegaST Real-Time Clock (set clock not tested)
- NVRAM (including RTC)
- Blitter (Blitmode() just returns HW status)
- Microwire
- SCC
- IDE
- ACSI
- The Native Features interface to some degree

Currently unsupported hardware features:
- DSP
- MFP #2
- TT 256-colour palette

EmuTOS is also available on some non-Atari hardware:
- Amiga (WinUAE, Amiga 1000, Amiga 1200 with Blizzard 1260)
- ColdFire Evaluation Boards (M5484LITE, M5485EVB)
