EmuTOS source code consists of several parts, and includes code taken from 
other projects - we thank to them and to their authors for releasing the 
code under GPL.

The 'historical' authors - those who wrote the code before the start of the
EmuTOS project - are mentioned in the individual files they've authored.
Major 'historical' parts are:
- the GEMDOS source code, GPL DRI Blah blah blah
- aes/vdi? where does this come from?
- desktop ? where does this come from?

Minor borrowed stuff:
- the printf and memcpy stuff was inspired from the Minix kernel and library;
- the processor detection is taken from the MiNT kernel;
- Bug includes parts of the original gettext source code;
- some low-level hardware stuff comes from the Linux kernel;


Here is about the 'recent' contributors - individuals involved in the EmuTOS
project. In this project virtually everybody modifies every file,
nevertheless here is an attempt at identifying who's guilty of what: 

Martin Doering (MAD) <mdoering@gmx.net>
- project initiator and manager; 
- memory setup, VT52 console, linea, mouse
- virtually everything not modified later by the other fellows
- 
  
Petr Stehlik (joy) <>
- bios disk interface, BDOS filesystem
- Falcon and ARAnyM support

Thomas Huth (THH) <>
- ROMable EMuCON, everything graphic! AES, VDI, desktop, ...

Laurent Vogel (LVL) <lvl@club-internet.fr>
- original ST hardware (MFP, ACIA, parport, sound, floppy, ACSI)
- Makefile tricks and tools
- NLS support


Thanks also to all Mailing list contributors for their help, and 
especially:
- Frank Neumann
- ... (to be continued)
