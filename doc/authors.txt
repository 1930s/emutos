EmuTOS source code consists of several parts, and includes code taken from 
other projects - Many thanks to them and to their authors for releasing the 
code under GPL.

The 'historical' authors - those who wrote the code before the start of the
EmuTOS project - are mentioned in the individual files they've authored.
Major 'historical' parts are:
- BDOS, VDI, CLI - it comes from the latest known GEMDOS version from 
  Digital Research (later versions seem to have been developped by Atari). 
- AES, desktop - The C source code for GEM comes from the x86 version.
- some GEM assembler files come from the AES in the Apple LISA.

All this historical part was released under the General Public License by 
Caldera, Inc. in mid april 2000 (?)
(For the record, Caldera bought it from Novell in 1997 along with DR-DOS;
Later Caldera disappeared and this is the copyright notice refers to Lineo)

Minor borrowed stuff:
- the printf and memcpy stuff was inspired from the Minix kernel and library;
- the processor detection is taken from the MiNT kernel;
- Bug includes parts of the original gettext source code;
- some low-level hardware stuff comes from the Linux kernel;


Here is about the 'recent' contributors - individuals involved in the EmuTOS
project. In this project virtually everybody modifies every file,
nevertheless here is an attempt at identifying who's guilty of what: 

Martin Doering (MAD) <mdoering@mucl.de>
- project initiator and manager; 
- memory setup, VT52 console, linea, mouse
- virtually everything not modified later by the other fellows
  
Petr Stehlik (joy) <pstehlik@sophics.cz>
- bios disk interface, BDOS filesystem
- Falcon and ARAnyM support

Thomas Huth (THH) <thothy@users.sourceforge.net>
- Lots of VDI bugfixes
- Integration and maintenance of the AES and GEM-Desktop

Laurent Vogel (LVL) <lvl@club-internet.fr>
- original ST hardware (MFP, ACIA, parport, sound, floppy, ACSI)
- Makefile tricks and tools
- NLS support

Bohdan Milar <milarb@volny.cz>
- Czech translation
