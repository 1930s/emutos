- pexec: loaded program's memory is not released after exit
- Command.prg crashes, when commandline input is longer than line length
- EmuTOS crashes, if it boots from some STeem generated floppy images
- auto programs are not run after reset
- bad font, if run in STonX in mono and Y-resolution => 400 (STonX's bug)
