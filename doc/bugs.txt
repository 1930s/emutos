- Changing the VDI color palette is not possible on TT and Falcon.
- PROCALC.ACC doesn't open after changing the resolution.
- Desktop doesn't default to language specific time & date formats
  (G.g_ctimeform & G.g_cdateform don't get defaults from country.c/.mk).
- Drag-and-drop does not work in the freeware GEM games "Abalone"
  "Hotshot checkers", "Risky", "Yukon" and in the shareware solitair
  game "Patience".
- Mouse buttons don't work properly in several GEM programs:
  - In "Sysinfo" (v5.02) dialog buttons and window scrollbar buttons
    are selected only on mouse button release and acted only if
    press and release are within certain time of each other.
  - In "Patience", all the dialogs (quit, start new game) show
    the button selected last time still as selected and it needs
    to be unselected to use the dialog.
  - "Awele" v1.01 window menus close immediately after clicking to open
    them.  "Awele" v1.02 compiled with newer Windom version works fine.
  - In (original) "Ballerburg", moving mouse over the "Fertig" button
    in the wind strenght dialog activates the button without click.
  - Clicks don't work at all in "Yams" (mine sweeper) game.
  - In "Bombs" & "Mind Sweeper" (mine sweeper) games, it's pretty
    random whether mouse clicks go through.
- Lines drawn in VDI "transparent" mode show black 16(?) pixel
  wide boxes, demonstrated by Eero's "vditest".
- 6x6 font is missing characters 1->31, 194->223 and 255.
  The character 158 is wrong.  As a result small arrows don't
  show up in "Clac" RSC.
- Non-standard font sizes in "Gobang", "Sherlock", "Solitair",
  "Columns" are wrong (too small, e.g. 2px instead of 16px).
  In Sherlock the text for replies is positioned wrong too.
- In Mario Becroft's GEM Pacman, "game over" melt effect happens
  for the whole screen, not just for the game window.
- In Mario Becroft's "Orb", the game area has some white thick
  vertical lines when game starts which don't show with normal TOS.
- EmuTOS panic's when running Warwick Allison's "GemAmigo",
  after vs_clip call.
- Shots go through buildings in GEM "Invaders" because EmuTOS
  returns 0 as VDI color index also for set pixels in monochrome.
- Moves in "Halma" leave boxes to places where game shows that
  pieces could have been moved, but weren't.
- In "MathMaze", game win dialog leaves some lines on screen.
- In "Core War" all the corewars programs shown in "memory" are
  white, in real TOS they have different patterns.
- 7UP hangs on exit.
