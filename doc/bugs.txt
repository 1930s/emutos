- EmuTOS crashes, if it boots from some STeem generated floppy images
- Changing the VDI color palette is not possible on TT and Falcon.
- Drag-and-drop does not work in the freeware GEM games "Abalone"
  "Hotshot checkers", "Risky", "Yukon" and in the shareware solitair
  game "Patience".
- In "Patience", all the dialogs (quit, start new game) show the button
  selected last time still as selected and it needs to be unselected
  to use the dialog. -> AES dialog handler bug?
- Mouse clicks don't work properly in several GEM games:
  - "Awele" window menus close immediately after clicking on them.
  - In (original) "Ballerburg", moving mouse over the "Fertig" button
    in the wind strenght dialog activates the button without click.
  - Clicks don't work at all in "Yams" (mine sweeper) game.
  - In "Bombs" & "Mind Sweeper" (mine sweeper) games, it's pretty
    random whether mouse clicks go through.
- Lines drawn in VDI "transparent" mode show black 16(?) pixel
  wide boxes, demonstrated by Eero's "vditest".
- Non-standard font sizes in "Gobang", "Sherlock", "Solitair",
  "Columns" are wrong (too small, e.g. 2px instead of 16px).
- Small arrow characters in free "Clac" calculator RSC are missing.
- In Thomas Binder's GEM Pacman, "game over" melt effect happens
  for the whole screen, not just for the game window.  Clip error?
- EmuTOS panic's when running Warwick Allison's "GemAmigo",
  after vs_clip call.
- Shots go through buildings in GEM "Invaders", maybe because it
  uses monochrome resolution with inverted colors?
- Moves in "Halma" leave boxes to places where game shows that
  pieces could have been moved, but weren't.
- In "MathMaze", game win dialog leaves some lines on screen.
- In Mario Becroft's "Orb", the game area has some white thick
  vertical lines when game starts which don't show with normal TOS.
- In "Core War" all the corewars programs shown in "memory" are
  white, in real TOS they have different patterns.
