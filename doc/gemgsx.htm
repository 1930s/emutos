<h1>11. The GEM-GSX Graphical lnterface</h1>
<hr>

The GEM-GSX graphics interface is documented in the  
manual set shipped with Digital Research's GEM product.
Please refer to that documentation set for further Information. 


<h2>11.01 Multi-Tasking</h2>

Two multitasking schemes are proposed. Both mantain complete  
process models in memory. Both types can exist concurrently  
within the system 

The first type of multitasking  is a background activity (such as  
communications or printer spooling) that is interrupt driven and  
requires only a small percentage of the total processing time.  
such tasks can run concurrently with a foreground process.
Only one background process can run at any given time. 

The second type of multitasking allows two or more processes  
in the foreground at once with all processes suspended but the  
one In the active window.  the active window it defined by the  
cursor position - moving the cursor from one window to another  
freezes the process the cursor leaves and activates the one it
enters. When activated, a process retrieves an interask  
Communication from a designated pipe or queue. The number  
of applications running in this mode are limited only by available memory. 


<h2>Real Time Response</h2>

The design goal for handling real-time Interrupts and exception requests  
is  100 rnicroseconds or less. This response speed supports foreground  
communications applications running at XXX baud.  (19K baud)
