<h2>1.01. Minimum System</h2>


 The GEM DOS operating system requires a minimum system configuration
 that supports its  capabilities. In  particular, this includes both
 RAM  and  ROM  storage, bit-mapped video controller and display and
 a mouse or other pointing device.

<pre>
          --  68000 microprocessor
          --  Bit mapped video controller card and a display with
              320 by 200 resolution
          --  128 Kbytes RAM
          --  160 Kbytes ROM
          --  An optical or track mouse. or other pointing device
</pre>

<h2>1.02. Expanded System</h2>


 While OEM DOS runs and "exercises" its features with the system
 configuration above, the expanded high-performance system described
 below uses the full capabilities of OEM DOS.


<pre>
    -   68010, 68020, or 68070 advanced microprocessor
    -   High resolution, color bit-map display and controller (640 by 400
        pixel resolution, barrel shifterhardware for very high speed
        screen refresh)
    -   256 Kbytes of RAM to support sophisticated applications and
        multitasking 192 Kbytes of ROM, including
               additional desk accessories
               Mouse Disk drives and controllers
               Optical drives and controllers
               printer and communication ports
</pre>
