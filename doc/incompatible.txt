Programs incompatible with EmuTOS
=================================
This is a list of programs that have program bugs or shortcomings that
prevent them from running properly with EmuTOS, and whose problem has
been definitively identified.  It is mainly intended to prevent these
programs from being added to 'bugs.txt' in the future.

Program: Awele v1.01
--------------------
Error: mono desktop colours are inverted after exiting program.
Bug analysis:
This version of Awele was compiled with PureC and linked with a very
early version of Windform.  During WinDOM initialisation, malloc() is
called to allocate an area to save the palette in.  However, although
malloc() returns the pointer in A0, the WinDOM code assumes it is in D0.
As a result, an area of low memory is pointed to, which is overwritten
during Awele execution.  At program termination, the palette is restored
from the overwritten area, resulting in the error seen.

Program: Cameleon
-----------------
Error 1: program exits immediately when 'Start game" is selected.
Bug analysis:
The program requires an STe.  In order to determine whether its's
running on an STe, it checks the contents of location 0x995 (hardcoded).
On Atari TOS, this is where TOS initialisation happens to store the _MCH
cookie but this is *not* how Atari says you should locate it (and it's
not where EmuTOS stores it).
Error 2: program crashes with a Trace exception on any exit.
Bug analysis:
During startup, the program switches to supervisor state via the Super()
system call.  Subsequently, the supervisor stack overwrites the program's
user stack.  On exit, the user stack pointer is restored and during this
a corrupted value is loaded into the SR, causing a trace excpetion.

Program: Invaders (VDI) and Anduril
-----------------------------------
Error: keys to move an object are ignored (in Invaders, the '-' key; in
Anduril, the 'h' & 'j' keys)
Bug analysis:
Both programs were written by "M.Dheus" who found that the most recent
key input from the keyboard was stored at offset 0x6d from the address
returned by Kbdvbase(), and used that to read the keyboard.  This was
never documented by Atari, but was apparently true for all versions of
TOS 1.  However it is not true for TOS 2, 3, or 4 (or EmuTOS).
