EmuTOS - 192 KB versions

These ROMs are suitable for the following hardware:
- ST / STf
- Mega ST
- emulators of the above

Unlike other ROM versions, they do NOT autodetect extra hardware, and might not
work on machines with additional hardware. For example, they don't work under
Hatari emulator's Falcon emulation due to missing VIDEL support.

Each ROM contains a single language:

etos192de.img - German
etos192es.img - Spanish
etos192fi.img - Finnish
etos192fr.img - French

etos192it.img - Italian
etos192ru.img - Russian
etos192sg.img - Swiss German
