EmuTOS - floppy versions

These special versions allow EmuTOS to be loaded from a boot floppy
without the need of replacing the system ROM.
This is the simplest way to test EmuTOS on real hardware from a floppy.
The drawback is less available RAM compared to ROM versions.

These floppies are provided in the form of raw single-sided floppy images.
They can be used as is on most emulators.

In order to use a floppy image on real hardware, first you need to write it
to a real floppy using some raw image tool.

On Windows, you can use the RawWrite tool:
