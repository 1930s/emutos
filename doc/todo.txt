BIOS/XBIOS/BDOS
- implement XBIOS calls
- implement Line-A functions
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- reduce the number of 'extern' in .c files
- check that RAM disks work
- misc. TODOs in floppy.c
- check that VEC_CRITICALERR (0x101) is called when the BIOS encounters errors
- should hitting control-c terminate the current process? if so, how?
- move mem-only routines out of proc.c into umem.c or iumem.c
- improve Mediach()
- implement full XHDI 1.30
- loop callibration needed for various delays in centronics and DMA ports
- bdos/time.c: Use XBIOS time functions instead of date_time().

Internationalisation
- bugs in tools/bug.c; more things should be configurable on the command line

VDI
- Check the various assembler routines that are called from C functions
  if they save and restore enough registers.
- The linemask for dashed lines is not calculated correct, depending on 
  the internal calculations of increase in x direction, like in original TOS.
- vs_color and vq_color don't work with TT shifter and Falcon Videl yet.

AES
- Check if all strings in desk_rsc.c and gem_rsc.c are fully ROM save (the
  TEDINFO strings etc).

DESK
- Add a dialog for resolution switching
- Support for loading DESKTOP.INF (needs remapping of the icon indices)

CLI
- Needs a lot of memory due to static buffers ("char buf[10000]" etc.)
- use extended argv specification in EmuCON
- EmuCON should allow 'exit' in .BAT scripts?
- Input/Output redirection does not work well (problems with spaces after
  the ">" for example).

Bug report from Eero:
- Rename emuconf.inf to end up with .ttp and click to the file:
  EmuTOS says that my machine doesn't have enough memory
  to run the program... (should say that it's not executable)
- If I copy a file twice from one dir to another, I don't get the name
  conflict dialog.  If I do it within the same dialog, I get the error
  dialog.
