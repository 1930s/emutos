- implement XBIOS calls
- implement linea functions 
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- check that RAM disks work (an easy way to test bdos under STonX)
- pexec: loaded program's memory is not released after exit
- Command.prg crashes, when commandline input is longer than line length
- Scrolling is bad, if STonX uses some big color video resolutions  
- implement flopvbl (deselect idle drive), other TODOs in floppy.c
- VDI: code cleanup, Makefile, esclisa and gsxvars like in EmuTOS
- EmuTOS crashes, if it boots from some STeem generated floppy images
- add clock driver for nvram clock
- Go on with implementing mouse driver
- kpanic() and like should print on screen then use STOP opcode.
- since nvram.c STonX does not run anymore
