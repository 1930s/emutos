- implement XBIOS calls
- implement linea functions 
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- check that RAM disks work (an easy way to test bdos under STonX)
- pexec: loaded program's memory is not released after exit
- Command.prg crashes, when commandline input is longer than line length
- Scrolling is bad, if STonX uses some big color video resolutions  
- implement mediach, and flopvbl (to deselect the drive when idle)
- VDI: code cleanup, Makefile, esclisa and gsxvars like in EmuTOS
- EmuTOS crashes, if it boots from some STeem generated floppy images
- nvmaccess does not check the cksum
- add clock driver for nvram clock
-> are you sure? - Change char, int, long to BYTE, WORD, LONG
- Go on with implementing mouse driver
