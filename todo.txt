- implement XBIOS calls
- implement linea functions 
- add argument specifications in function prototypes
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- cleaning function prototypes, checking compiler warnings.
- check that RAM disks work (an easy way to test bdos under STonX)
- pexec: loaded program's memory is not released after exit
- Command.prg crashes, when commandline input is longer than line length
- Scrolling is bad, if STonX uses some big color video resolutions  
- implement mediach, and flopvbl (to deselect the drive when idle)
- allow international printed messages
- handle international keyboards
- the ROM EmuCON does not lauch commands when booting on a floppy 
  (the autoexec'd command.prg still does)
- bconin needs to have different keyboard mappings
- VDI: code cleanup, Makefile, esclisa and gsxvars like in EmuTOS
- EmuTOS crashes, if it boots from some STeem generated floppy images
