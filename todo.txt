- implement XBIOS calls
- implement screen handling better and in assembler
- one should not have to type "make clean ; make" each time one changes a file.
- would be nice, if .o files would be in archived libs for each subdir
- add argument specifications in function prototypes
- merge identical headers, and put them all in an include directory (?)
- a working kprintf(), to ease debugging messages.
- cleaning function prototypes, checking compiler warnings.
- complete vt52 console, in low, med, high rez.
- low-level floppy support (rwabs, booting a floppy)
